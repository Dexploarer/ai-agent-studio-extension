Project Description:
{project_description}

Team, let's work together to deliver this project! Here's our process:

1. **Requirements Analysis** (Product Owner + Architect)
   - Clarify requirements and constraints
   - Define technical specifications

2. **Architecture Design** (Architect)
   - Design system architecture
   - Define technology stack and patterns

3. **Implementation Planning** (Developer + Architect)
   - Break down features into tasks
   - Estimate effort and timeline

4. **Development** (Developer)
   - Implement core functionality
   - Write clean, documented code

5. **Quality Assurance** (QA Engineer)
   - Review code and create tests
   - Validate functionality

6. **Deployment Planning** (DevOps Engineer)
   - Design CI/CD pipeline
   - Plan infrastructure needs

7. **Documentation** (Technical Writer)
   - Create user and developer documentation

Let's start with requirements analysis. Product Owner, please provide any additional details or constraints.
